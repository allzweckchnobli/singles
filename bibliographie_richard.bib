This study compared online video-based instruction that made use of relationship-building strategies with online video-based instruction that did not use those strategies. The two instructions were identical in every other way. The results show that the attitudes of the college students were positively affected by the relationship building strategies in a statistically significant way (p = .025) and that learning gains were also positively affected at a very near-significant level (p = .052).

	abstract = {Students experience challenges when understanding visual information in multimedia learning. Specifically, immersive multimedia environments, such as virtual reality increase the likelihood that students undergo distractions in which information seeking during system-paced instruction occurred. Although previous studies have reviewed various cue designs to yield students’ higher attention, skepticism still exists regarding which ways cue designs can support their learning comprehension in video instruction. For this study, we sampled a total of 64 undergraduates in a university. Using video instruction performed by an animated pedagogical agent ({APA}), this study examined the effect of social (i.e., an {APA}’s conversational gestures) and cognitive (i.e., visual cue) cues on students’ learning comprehension and eye-gaze data within types of visual information (text and pictorial). Also, this study investigated how both cues promoted students’ cognitive load overall. Specific to text information processing, the results of the study confirmed that the negative prime effect of social cues undermined students’ learning comprehension and increased their cognitive load, whereas cognitive cues appeared to be supportive in video instruction. Also, this study found that students’ different visual-attention patterns appeared in pictorial information processing. In terms of pictorial information processing, the study finding implies that whereas social cues caused visual distractions and lowered learning comprehension, cognitive cues as visual cues helped learners to integrate pictorial information via visuospatial clues. Conclusively, we reported several design implications derived from the study findings.},

Students were assigned to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 × 2 factorial design that varied (1) instruction medium (video vs. live), and (2) instruction modality (speech vs. speech + gesture). There was no main effect of medium: The same amount of learning occurred whether instruction was done live or on video. There was a main effect of modality: Speech instruction accompanied by gesture resulted in significantly more learning and transfer than instruction conveyed through speech only. Gesture’s effect on instruction was stronger for video instruction than live instruction. These findings suggest that there may be a limit to gesture’s role in communication that results in student learning.},

We conducted a systematic review to examine the impact of an on-screen instructor on learning and affect. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Our analysis of the results showed no consistent, compelling evidence that an instructor should be included on-screen in instructional videos, as non-significant and mixed results were pervasive throughout the literature. However, we also did not find convincing evidence to leave an instructor out of the instructional video, as some studies found that learners were more satisfied when the instructor was visually-present. We explore these results in more depth, highlight the need for more studies in the area, and outline potentially productive frameworks for systematic lines of research.},

This study aims to analyze published work on the video-based learning to assist teachers and other educational professionals in widening their understanding of the educational benefits of the video-based learning. Also, this analysis provides video-based learning possibilities that can improve teacher/student learning and the overall quality of the classroom experience.

There was a significant difference in learners' motivation in terms of attention between the video-based instruction and traditional text-based instruction. In addition, the learners reported that the video-based instruction was more memorable than the traditional text-based instruction.

The study synthesizes the trends observed through the analysis of 178 papers selected from the screening of 2531 abstracts. The findings summarize the effects of manipulating video presentation, content and tasks on learning outcomes, such as recall, transfer, academic achievement, among others. The study points out the gap between large-scale analysis of fine-grained data on video interaction and experimental findings reliant on established psychological instruments. Narrowing this gap is suggested as the future direction for the research on video-based learning.},

	abstract = {Importance
              Although most research has linked video gaming to subsequent increases in aggressive behavior in children after accounting for prior aggression, findings have been divided with respect to video gaming’s association with cognitive skills.
            
            
              Objective
              To examine the association between video gaming and cognition in children using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ({ABCD}) study.
            
            
              Design, Setting, and Participants
              In this case-control study, cognitive performance and blood oxygen level–dependent ({BOLD}) signal were compared in video gamers ({VGs}) and non–video gamers ({NVGs}) during response inhibition and working memory using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) in a large data set of 9- and 10-year-old children from the {ABCD} study, with good control of demographic, behavioral, and psychiatric confounding effects. A sample from the baseline assessment of the {ABCD} 2.0.1 release in 2019 was largely recruited across 21 sites in the {US} through public, private, and charter elementary schools using a population neuroscience approach to recruitment, aiming to mirror demographic variation in the {US} population. Children with valid neuroimaging and behavioral data were included. Some exclusions included common {MRI} contraindications, history of major neurologic disorders, and history of traumatic brain injury.
            
            
              Exposures
              Participants completed a self-reported screen time survey including an item asking children to report the time specifically spent on video gaming. All {fMRI} tasks were performed by all participants.
            
            
              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Video gaming time, cognitive performance, and {BOLD} signal assessed with n-back and stop signal tasks on {fMRI}. Collected data were analyzed between October 2019 and October 2020.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 2217 children (mean [{SD}] age, 9.91 [0.62] years; 1399 [63.1\%] female) participated in this study. The final sample used in the stop signal task analyses consisted of 1128 {NVGs} (0 gaming hours per week) and 679 {VGs} who played at least 21 hours per week. The final sample used in the n-back analyses consisted of 1278 {NVGs} who had never played video games (0 hours per week of gaming) and 800 {VGs} who played at least 21 hours per week. The {VGs} performed better on both {fMRI} tasks compared with the {NVGs}. Nonparametric analyses of {fMRI} data demonstrated a greater {BOLD} signal in {VGs} in the precuneus during inhibitory control. During working memory, a smaller {BOLD} signal was observed in {VGs} in parts of the occipital cortex and calcarine sulcus and a larger {BOLD} signal in the cingulate, middle, and frontal gyri and the precuneus.
            
            
              Conclusions and Relevance
              In this study, compared with {NVGs}, {VGs} were found to exhibit better cognitive performance involving response inhibition and working memory as well as altered {BOLD} signal in key regions of the cortex responsible for visual, attention, and memory processing. The findings are consistent with videogaming improving cognitive abilities that involve response inhibition and working memory and altering their underlying cortical pathways.},

	abstract = {This article summarizes some emerging concerns as learning analytics become implemented throughout education. The article takes a sociotechnical perspective — positioning learning analytics as shaped by a range of social, cultural, political, and economic factors. In this manner, various concerns are outlined regarding the propensity of learning analytics to entrench and deepen the status quo, disempower and disenfranchise vulnerable groups, and further subjugate public education to the profit-led machinations of the burgeoning “data economy.” In light of these charges, the article briefly considers some possible areas of change. These include the design of analytics applications that are more open and accessible, that offer genuine control and oversight to users, and that better reflect students’ lived reality. The article also considers ways of rethinking the political economy of the learning analytics industry. Above all, learning analytics researchers need to begin talking more openly about the values and politics of data-driven analytics technologies as they are implemented along mass lines throughout school and university contexts.},

	abstract = {It was the belief that assessment is the driving force of curriculum that motivated the authors of this monograph to embark on a program of research and development into the use of digital technologies to support more authentic forms of assessment. They perceived that in responding to the educational needs of children in the 21st Century, curriculum needed to become more relevant and engaging, but that change was unlikely without commensurate change in methods and forms of assessment. This was particularly true for the high-stakes assessment typically conducted at the conclusion of schooling as this tended to become the focus of the implemented curriculum throughout the years of school. Therefore the authors chose to focus on this area of assessment with the understanding that this would inform assessment policy and practices generally in schools. This book provides a conceptual framework and outlines a project in which digital methods of representing students performance were developed and tested in the subject areas of Applied Information Technology, Engineering, Italian and Physical Education. The methodology and data collection processes are discussed, and the data is analysed, providing the basis for conclusions and recommendations--Résumé de l'éditeur},

In this article we investigated if and how a workshop-based in-service teacher training can foster teachers’ perceived value of digital media in mathematics education, their self-efficacy, and their anxiety towards teaching mathematics with digital tools. In an intervention study with
              N

              -tests with pretest and posttest data revealed that for two of three clusters these beliefs, motivation, and emotions changed in a positive way during the intervention while for the third no change was found. Our study sheds light on the role of motivational and emotional orientations for the implementation of digital tools in mathematics education: it shows that these orientations can be utilized to cluster teachers on this topic and illustrates that these orientations can be successfully fostered—while individual differences may exist in the effect and success of interventions.},

              The results of three meta-analyses show that the effectiveness of learning from animations, when compared to learning from static pictures, is rather limited. A recent re-analysis of one of these meta-analyses, however, supports that learning from animations is considerably more effective than learning from static pictures if the specifics of the displayed changes need to be learned. In order to further validate this finding as well as to clarify the educational strengths and weaknesses of animations and static pictures, an experimental study with three groups was conducted. Overall, 88 university students participated in the study. One group of learners (
              n
               = 30) watched a single picture of a gear mechanism, one group of learners (
              n
               = 28) watched four pictures, and one group of learners (
              n
               = 30) watched an animation. All groups had to identify specific motions and spatial arrangements covered by the gear mechanism. While learners who watched the animation exhibited the best performance with respect to the identification of motions, learners who watched the pictures showed the best performance with respect to the identification of spatial arrangements. The effect sizes are large. The results of the study help to clarify when animations and when static pictures are most suitable for learning.},

Problematisch daran ist, dass Videos oft nur beiläufig geschaut und oberflächlich verarbeitet werden. In der aufgabenbasierten Vorbereitungsphase befassen sich die Studierenden mit geeigneten Aufgaben anstelle von Vorlesungsvideos. Dadurch sollen lernrelevante kognitive Prozesse initiiert werden, welche wiederum höhere Lernergebnisse in der gemeinsamen Präsenzphase ermöglichen können. Auf Basis der Revised Taxonomy nach Anderson und Krathwohl (2001) und der Basismodelle nach Oser und Patry (1994) sowie Oser und Baeriswyl (2001) wurde eine aufgabenbasierte Flipped-Classroom-Einheit mit dem Ziel konzipiert, den außerhochschulischen Lernraum in der Vorbereitungsphase effektiver zu nutzen. In einer ersten Studie zeichneten sich gewisse Vorteile der aufgabenbasierten Vorbereitungsphase gegenüber derjenigen mit Vorlesungsvideos ab. ({DIPF}/Orig.)},

No advantage was found for either format on the basis of quiz scores. Students appreciated the convenience of online lectures but preferred in-class lectures because of the increased ease of maintaining attention in the more structured environment. Attendance, as well as access of online content, decreased during the course of the study, suggesting that hybrid courses may lead to decreases in overall student effort.},

We examined 46 meta-analyses only to find remarkably different overall effects, raising the question about possible moderators and confounds, showing the need to control for the nature of the intervention. We then conducted a meta-analysis of 173 studies specifically coding the nature of the flipped implementation. In contrast to many claims, most in-class sessions are not modified based on the flipped implementation. Furthermore, it was flipping followed by a more traditional class and not active learning that was more effective. Drawing on related research, we proposed a more specific model for flipping, “Fail, Flip, Fix, and Feed” whereby students are asked to first engage in generating solutions to novel problems even if they fail to generate the correct solutions, before receiving instructions.},

            In socially shared regulation of learning, adaptation is a key process for overcoming collaborative learning challenges. Monitoring the learning process allows learners to recognize the situations that require a need to change, revise, or optimize the current learning process. This can be done through adapting their strategies, task perception, goals, or standards for monitoring their progress. This process is called small-scale adaptation. It is not yet clear how shared monitoring in groups activates small-scale adaptation “on the fly” or how this phenomenon can be detected using multimodal data. The aim of this study is to explore how small-scale adaptation emerges during collaboration. Video and heart rate data were collected from four groups of three high-school students (age 16–17) who worked together during six 75-min advanced physics lessons. The results show small-scale adaptation occurs most often when groups switch from enacting tasks to defining them. Physiological synchrony occurred throughout the collaboration and was not significantly more prevalent before or after adaptation occurred. The opportunities and challenges of combining video observation to identify monitoring and adaptation events, and physiological synchrony as a possible indicator of “sharedness,” are discussed, contributing to the literature about using multimodal data to study learning processes.},

              This study investigates student and teacher use of online instructional {YouTube} chemistry videos in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Data were collected from a global sample of students (
              n
               = 1147) subscribed to the first author’s popular chemistry education {YouTube} channel. Participants were in secondary school or college and reported having learned science in a variety of contexts including completely online, blended, or completely in-person. The data collection instrument, an online questionnaire, was designed to detect both quantitative and qualitative changes in the use of instructional video. In addition, statistics for the overall {YouTube} chemistry education channel for 2018 through 2021 were compiled to provide evidence of video viewing trends with a large sample (98.6 million video views) over a timeframe encompassing before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings indicate that students’ personal use of video for learning science increased substantially during the pandemic. However, for the majority of teachers, the use of video to support online learning during the pandemic either remained the same or declined. Post-pandemic, students plan to continue using science videos for learning and want teachers to do the same.},

            The positivity principle states that people learn better from instructors who display positive emotions rather than negative emotions. In two experiments, students viewed a short video lecture on a statistics topic in which an instructor stood next to a series of slides as she lectured and then they took either an immediate test (Experiment 1) or a delayed test (Experiment 2). In a between-subjects design, students saw an instructor who used her voice, body movement, gesture, facial expression, and eye gaze to display one of four emotions while lecturing: happy (positive/active), content (positive/passive), frustrated (negative/active), or bored (negative/passive). First, learners were able to recognize the emotional tone of the instructor in an instructional video lecture, particularly by more strongly rating a positive instructor as displaying positive emotions and a negative instructor as displaying negative emotions (in Experiments 1 and 2). Second, concerning building a social connection during learning, learners rated a positive instructor as more likely to facilitate learning, more credible, and more engaging than a negative instructor (in Experiments 1 and 2). Third, concerning cognitive engagement during learning, learners reported paying more attention during learning for a positive instructor than a negative instructor (in Experiments 1 and 2). Finally, concerning learning outcome, learners who had a positive instructor scored higher than learners who had a negative instructor on a delayed posttest (Experiment 2) but not an immediate posttest (Experiment 1). Overall, there is evidence for the positivity principle and the cognitive-affective model of e-learning from which it is derived.},

            Mathematics plays a significant role in many study programs. However, several studies show deficiencies and a decline in beginning undergraduates’ skills in mathematics in many content domains. However, it remains unclear whether they have improved in so-called process competencies like modeling, mathematical reasoning, or using different representations instead, because there has been a shift towards the acquisition of such in many recent curricula. We investigated this issue at a university in Germany based on data from a (non-standardized) mathematics entry test taken by 3076 economics students divided into different cohorts from 2012 to 2019. Using regression analyses, we found that, on the one hand, students’ ability to carry out symbolic calculations decreased. On the other hand, their performance increased in some test questions focusing on other process competencies like reasoning, mathematizing, or using different representations, which have become common tasks at school due to a stronger emphasis on these process competencies after a curriculum reform. Our data indicate that this reform might have had the desired effect.},

              This article utilizes a framework for classifying different scientific methods suggested by a philosopher of science (Brandon
              Synthese
              , 99, 59–73, 1994) called Brandon’s Matrix. It presents findings from teachers who took part in a funded project in England that looked at the nature of scientific methods in science investigations. Science investigations are an integral aspect of science education and, as such, are often included in high stakes examinations. Therefore, teachers need to have a good understanding of  a range of scientific methods and their purposes in science investigations. The framework was used to ask teachers to classify science investigations based on how they teach them. It was also employed to devise assessments to measure students’ understanding of scientific methods. The teachers were introduced to the new approaches and their perceptions were gathered to understand if they supported this as a framework for their classroom practice. Evidence from the study suggested that Brandon’s Matrix appealed to teachers as a framework for practical science in schools, and they see potential benefits for its use in the teaching, learning, and assessment of science. Findings from the study showed it appealed to the teachers as a tool for classifying scientific methods, and how they also recognized the importance of assessing practical work and had an appreciation of the constraints and drivers in the current curriculum and assessment requirements in England. Implications for teachers’ professional development are discussed.},

            Emotions play an essential role in educational processes. Previous research has mainly dealt with achievement emotions which are experienced in specific situations such as exams or learning situations in mathematics (e.g. enjoyment or anxiety). Some achievement emotions are rather experienced in social contexts in mathematics and are closely related to the self. These emotions such as shame are assumed to be also relevant for mathematics achievement. However, a reliable and valid instrument is missing to measure shame in mathematics. Validity evidence for the newly developed Shame in Mathematics Questionnaire ({SHAME}-Q) was collected in three studies with pre-service primary teachers. Study 1 investigated the content validity by conducting a systematic expert panel study. Study 2 and study 3 examined with two different samples the factorial structure and relations to other constructs in terms of discriminant (enjoyment) and convergent (anxiety) validity as well as to pre-service teachers’ grade in school mathematics, their intention to teach mathematics at school, and gender. The data supported strongly the validity assumptions as well as reliability and parsimony of the instrument. Psychometric limitations of {SHAME}-Q and applicability of the questionnaire are discussed.},

            This paper reports on research which explored the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of preservice primary teachers, where efficacy beliefs describe individuals’ beliefs in their potential to enact teaching to promote learning. Efficacy was conceptualised as a bi-faceted construct consisting of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. This research sought to establish the extent to which differences in efficacy are explained by students’ mathematics attainment level prior to entry into teacher education; the educational level of the students (whether postgraduate or undergraduate); students’ sense of preparedness to teach mathematics on school placement; and students’ gender. A total of 186 students responded to a questionnaire designed to measure their efficacy beliefs after completing one taught mathematics education module in university and one teaching practice placement in primary schools. Bivariate and regression analysis pointed to complex relationships between the explanatory and outcome variables. On bivariate analysis, findings included statistically significant associations between gender, mathematics attainment, preparedness to teach, and one or both of personal efficacy and outcome expectancy. In the regression analysis, gender was statistically significantly associated with outcome expectancy, while preparedness to teach and mathematics attainment were statistically significantly correlated with personal efficacy. Personal efficacy and outcome expectancy were significantly correlated on bivariate analysis, but significance was not retained after controlling for other factors in the regression models. This research has implications for teacher educators in understanding factors explaining mathematics teaching efficacy and therefore helping to better prepare preservice teachers to teach mathematics in the primary school classroom.},

This means that the knowledge-related kernel of education is not diminished, and that the role of teachers and instruction is not devalued either. Against this background, the article addresses the implications of competence-oriented instruction for actual (subject-specific) teaching practice, and pursues the questions pertaining to the role of teachers as diagnosticians and creators of learning settings.},

Following the first predominantly ethno-methodological phase, current research focuses on the investigation of the collaborative culture of learning, analyzing both shared and individual knowledge. At this stage, research is mainly based on the principle of ecological validity, implemented by means of complex designs and field experiments. The presented surveys of five research groups show a change in methodology that is called interactive or integrative methodology. Finally, this contribution refers to possible consequences for educational philosophy and technology. ({DIPF}/Orig.)},

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen an increasing stress on the need to monitor and manage educators, and hold them to account. This article argues that, while learning outcomes can be valuable if properly used, they have been misappropriated and adopted widely at all levels within the education system to facilitate the managerial process. This has led to their distortion. The claim that they can be made precise by being written with a prescribed vocabulary of special descriptors so as to serve as objective, measurable devices for monitoring performance, is fundamentally mistaken, and they may be damaging to education when used in this way. After a brief sketch of the background to the notion of learning outcomes, arguments are presented to show their vacuity and uselessness when misused in this way, and explanations of their inadequacies are offered.},

Contrary to previous findings in medicine, but similar to psychology, the majority of education replications successfully replicated the original studies. However, replications were significantly less likely to be successful when there was no overlap in authorship between the original and replicating articles.

Because the teaching method “inverted classroom” and class results directly relate to the quality of the video material one of the columns of lecture video production is the involvement of students in the lecture film production. First year students directly benefit from their fellow student learning experience, needs and perspective on teaching material. From the lecturers perspective students were generally more active and better prepared during class resulting in better grades.

The methodological research and implications for the design of teaching are clearly described based on an example from biology, history and geography didactics. The importance of the model is discussed for teacher training.},

In the current study, I present cumulative exam performance and student evaluation data from two sections of a statistics course I recently taught: one a traditional lecture ( N = 19) and the other a flipped class ( N = 24). Independent samples t-tests revealed students in the flipped classroom outperformed their lecture peers by more than a letter grade on the final exam. Further, these students were more satisfied with the course overall, a novel finding in this burgeoning area of research. This latter point, I argue, is likely due to the strong cohesion between the in-class and out-of-class content.},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surprising phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

	abstract = {Im Flipped Classroom oder Inverted Classroom bereiten sich Studierende in der Regel mit Hilfe von Vorlesungsvideos auf die Präsenzveranstaltungen vor. Problematisch daran ist, dass Videos oft nur beiläufig geschaut und oberflächlich verarbeitet werden. In der aufgabenbasierten Vorbereitungsphase befassen sich die Studierenden mit geeigneten Aufgaben anstelle von Vorlesungsvideos. Dadurch sollen lernrelevante kognitive Prozesse initiiert werden, welche wiederum höhere Lernergebnisse in der gemeinsamen Präsenzphase ermöglichen können. Auf Basis der Revised Taxonomy nach Anderson und Krathwohl (2001) und der Basismodelle nach Oser und Patry (1994) sowie Oser und Baeriswyl (2001) wurde eine aufgabenbasierte Flipped-Classroom-Einheit mit dem Ziel konzipiert, den außerhochschulischen Lernraum in der Vorbereitungsphase effektiver zu nutzen. In einer ersten Studie zeichneten sich gewisse Vorteile der aufgabenbasierten Vorbereitungsphase gegenüber derjenigen mit Vorlesungsvideos ab. ({DIPF}/Orig.)},

Allerdings hat die Portfolio-Methode einen direkten Einfluss auf die Lernsituation, in der die Reflexion des eignen Lernprozesses aber auch das gegenseitige Feedback einen großen Stellenwert einnimmt.

Die Reflexion des eigenen Lernens ist zentral und gleichzeitig ein potenzieller Punkt des Scheiterns bei der E-Portfolio-Arbeit im Studium. Es bedarf eines langfristigen Lernprozesses, um mit dem individuellen Wissen systematisch und verantwortungsbewusst umzugehen, und das betrifft alle Formen der Wissensarbeit. Zudem kommt es darauf an, dafür zu sorgen, dass die E-Portfolio-Arbeit nicht im Prüfungs- und Klausurmodus verharrt und in der Folge für das persönliche Wissensmanagement unbrauchbar wird. Im Zentrum steht die Aufgabe, die Studierenden dazu anzuregen, sich langfristig mit ihrem Lernprozess und den erworbenen Kompetenzen auseinanderzusetzen. ({DIPF}/Orig.)},

Bei der abschließenden Untersuchung mit Hilfe von Alumni-Interviews stand im Vordergrund, die Perspektive der Studierenden einzunehmen. Welchen Nutzen hatten das E-Portfolio und die darin eingebetteten digitalen Medien für das Studium und darüber hinaus? Welche Probleme traten bei der Verwendung auf und wie gingen die Lernenden damit um? Die Fallstudie auf Basis der Grounded-Theory-Methodik zeigt, dass ein idealtypischer Verlauf der E-Portfolio-Nutzung in vier Phasen beschrieben werden kann, in denen sich Studierende orientieren, positionieren, identifizieren und präsentieren. Neben der Kurzbeschreibung dieses 4-Phasen-Modells werden Probleme, erfolgskritische Faktoren und Handlungsstrategien der Studierenden in den vier Phasen angeführt. Zum Verständnis des Modells werden im ersten Teil des Beitrages der Kontext der Studie sowie die wesentlichen Aspekte der E-Portfolio-Implementierung dargelegt – eine detaillierte Beschreibung des Konzepts, des Forschungsdesigns und der empirischen Nachweise finden sich in der Dissertation von Himpsl-Gutermann (2012).

            The educational use of portfolios has been increasing in the last few years, especially as technology has also developed electronic versions of portfolios. Although there is abundant information about their benefits and practice description, few studies provide empirical evidence of their implementation. The objective of this study was to provide initial evidence about the use of the portfolio in higher education. Concretely, we aimed 1) to explore the correlation between students’ performance on the portfolio and their performance on more traditional assessment methods 2) to explore whether student’s personal variables predict performance in key elements of the e-portfolio, such as individual reflections, and if these contribute to general academic performance in the course, and 3) to evaluate whether the use of the e-portfolio during a semester changes the students’ self-efficacy and engagement. For this purpose, an initial sample of 73 students were recruited, and an e-portfolio (based on Mahara) was implemented over a semester. The results showed that performance on the portfolio correlated with the score obtained on multiple choice tests. There was an increase in self-efficacy after one semester of e-portfolio implementation, and engagement proved to be an important predictor of the final course grade through the mediation of individual reflections. These results offer preliminary and promising evidence about the relationship of a specific element of e-portfolios, individual reflections with several variables related to academic achievement such as self-efficacy and engagement.},

This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

	abstract = {In this Editorial, we stay committed to the objective of the Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice regarding sharing, evaluating, and developing stronger evidence-based practice papers by focusing on the topic of national and institutional student evaluations. We create an important theoretical and practical foundation for authors considering publishing with our Journal on studies that utilise student surveys as their primary method of data collection. The editorial begins by providing a comprehensive overview of the history and emergence of student evaluations dating back to medieval times, we trace the evolution of student evaluations to present day looking at the rationale behind the induction of such tools. Following this, we discuss the validity of student evaluations through an exploration of factors such as student satisfaction, the timing of when student surveys are administered, and the idiosyncrasies regarding paper-based and online evaluations. We then further discuss the reliability of student evaluations by contextualising what student evaluations do not say and uncover how various forms of bias can influence the ways student evaluations are both completed and interpreted. Through this we assert that due to confounding factors of bias that influence the results of student evaluations, they cannot always be thought of as wholly objective data collection tools. This then leads into our discussion of the contemporary social contexts within which student evaluations are situated and how both micro and macro dynamics influence student experiences of teaching and learning, where we contest that broader external factors experienced by students can skew the ways teaching is both perceived and evaluated. We conclude our Editorial by critically envisioning a new direction for future manuscript submissions to our Journal. We assert that although the use of student evaluations as evidence of teaching practice may be inherently flawed, there nonetheless remains merit in their use following critical and reflexive engagement throughout the research process. As such, we are hopeful that our critical review of student evaluation-based scholarship may be utilised to leverage higher quality research output.},

So far, the empirical evidence from previous studies has been limited and conflicting, and none of the studies have explored how learners' allocation of visual attention to the on-screen instructor influences learning and learner perceptions. Therefore, this study aimed to disentangle a) how instructor presence in online videos affects learning, learner perceptions (i.e., cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, situational interest), and visual attention distribution and b) to what extent visual attention patterns in instructor-present videos predict learning and learner perceptions. Sixty college students each watched two videos on Statistics, one on an easy topic and the other one on a difficult topic, with each in one of the two video formats: instructor-present or instructor-absent. Their eye movements were simultaneously registered using a desktop-mounted eye tracker. Afterwards, participants self-reported their cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, and situational interest for both videos, and feelings toward seeing the instructor for the instructor-present videos. Learning from the two videos was measured using retention and transfer questions. Findings indicated instructor presence a) improved transfer performance for the difficult topic, b) reduced cognitive load for the difficult topic, c) increased judgment of learning for the difficult topic, and d) enhanced satisfaction and situational interest for both topics. Most participants expressed a positive feeling toward the instructor. Results also showed the instructor attracted a considerable amount of overt visual attention in both videos, and the amount of attention allocated to the instructor positively predicted participants’ satisfaction level for both topics.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has called for a 33\% increase in the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) bachelor’s degrees completed per year and recommended adoption of empirically validated teaching practices as critical to achieving that goal. The studies analyzed here document that active learning leads to increases in examination performance that would raise average grades by a half a letter, and that failure rates under traditional lecturing increase by 55\% over the rates observed under active learning. The analysis supports theory claiming that calls to increase the number of students receiving {STEM} degrees could be answered, at least in part, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favor of active learning.
          , 
            
              To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 {SDs} under active learning (
              n
              = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (
              n
              = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the {STEM} disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (
              n
              ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe
              n
              calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate {STEM} education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

	abstract = {Objective At present, current didactic teaching delivery method help nursing students apply theory to clinical situations in an inefficient way. The flipped classroom ({FC}), a novel teaching mode emphasizing self-study and critical thinking, has generated interest in nursing education in China. However, there are a gap in the literature and no consistent outcomes of current studies which compared {FC} and lecture-based learning ({LBL}), and no systematic review has comprehensively compared theoretical scores as an affected outcome in {FC} versus {LBL} modes.
Methods In this review, we analyze flipped-learning nursing students’ scores, and aim to assess the efficacy and provide a deeper understanding of the {FC} in nursing education. Following the inclusion criteria, articles were obtained by searching {PubMed}, Embase and Chinese data, including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and {VIP} database until 3 January 2020. Data were extracted from eligible articles and quality was assessed. A meta-analysis was then performed using a random effects model with a standardized mean value ({SMD}) and a 95\% confidence interval ({CI}).32 studies were included after reviewing 2,439 citations. All studies were randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}). The {FC} theoretical knowledge scores in {FC} were significantly positively affected compared to those of the traditional classroom ({SMD} = 1.33, 95\% {CI}: 1.02–1.64; P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, 23 studies reported skill scores, indicating significant difference between the {FC} mode and {LBL} mode ({SMD} = 1.58, 95\%{CI}: 1.23–1.93; P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest that compared to the {LBL} teaching method, the {FC} mode dose significantly improve Chinese nursing students’ theoretical scores. However,},

To carry out the study, 100 mathematics students in senior secondary school Hallmark Academy, in Rivers State, Nigeria were used in the study. There were two groups; an experimental and a control group used in the study. A {videoCD} offline mathematics lesson recorded by the teacher was the {ICT} instrument in this approach. The t-test was used to analyzed the data. Hence a major finding was that the experimental group had a mean gain of 28.60 as against 16.62 of those in a conventional class in their pretest-posttest scores. A major recommendation is that teachers should incorporate flipped classroom approach as it encourages direct involvement of students in the learning process.},

	abstract = {The “replication crisis” has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers’ widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The “null ritual,” unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 – p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20\% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39\% of the professors and lecturers, and 66\% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 – p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56\%–97\%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as “significant” or “not significant.”},

	abstract = {Die Digitalisierung erfasst als umfassender Prozess des gesellschaftlichen Wandels auch die Institutionen der unterschiedlichen Bildungsbereiche. Bildungspolitik, Forschung und Öffentlichkeit beschäftigen sich seit über zwei Jahrzehnten mit den »Neuen Medien«, deren Bedeutung in Bildung und Ausbildung kontinuierlich wächst. Computer, Tablet, Smartphone etc. ermöglichen eine umfassende Bereitstellung, Sicherung und Verbreitung dieser Daten. Der Zugang zu diesen aktuellen digitalen Instrumentarien und die Fähigkeit, sie zu nutzen, sind eine wichtige Voraussetzung für gesellschaftliche und berufliche Teilhabe. Zugleich sind jedoch die Kompetenzen im Umgang mit digitalen Medien und die kritische Reflexion ihrer Nutzung nur schwer zu überprüfen, und ihre Bedeutung für die Lernwirksamkeit ist bislang nicht unmittelbar nachgewiesen. Dennoch besteht häufig ein bildungspolitisches Desiderat, Anforderungen an die Medienkompetenz in allen personalen Entwicklungsstufen und Bildungsorten als Querschnittskompetenz zu formulieren. Auch deshalb stellen sich grundsätzliche Fragen nach den Auswirkungen einer »Omnipräsenz« digitaler Medien auf die Leistungsfähigkeit des Bildungs- und Ausbildungssystems, dessen Chancengleichheit und Integrationskraft. Der Bericht fasst die relevanten wissenschaftlichen Befunde zu Umfang und Konsequenzen der vielfältigen Einsatzmöglichkeiten neuer digitaler Medientypen im Bildungsbereich und für Lehr- und Lernmethoden zusammen. Er benennt für die verschiedenen Bildungskontexte die erforderlichen Rahmenbedingungen eines Einsatzes neuer digitaler Medien unter Ausschöpfung ihrer Potenziale. Zugleich werden Hemmnisse und Herausforderungen für die Nutzung digitaler Medien in den Bildungsbereichen identifiziert und erforderliche Bedingungen und Möglichkeiten zu ihrer Überwindung dargestellt.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as “gamification”, this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in humancomputer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how “gamification” relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate “gamification” and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that “gamified” applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of “gamification” as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

Empirical findings from laboratory and field studies demonstrate that learning motivation based on self-determination has a positive impact on the quality of learning. Furthermore, it can be shown that the social environment of both school and family plays an important role in the development of self-determined motivation.

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in learning approaches that combine two phases: an initial problem-solving phase followed by an instruction phase ({PS}-I). Two often cited examples of instructional approaches following the {PS}-I scheme include Productive Failure and Invention. Despite the growing interest in {PS}-I approaches, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a comprehensive attempt to summarize the features that define {PS}-I and to explain the patterns of results. Therefore, the first goal of this paper is to map the landscape of different {PS}-I implementations, to identify commonalities and differences in designs, and to associate the identified design features with patterns in the learning outcomes. The review shows that {PS}-I fosters learning only if specific design features (namely contrasting cases or building instruction on student solutions) are implemented. The second goal is to identify a set of interconnected cognitive mechanisms that may account for these outcomes. Empirical evidence from {PS}-I literature is associated with these mechanisms and supports an initial theory of {PS}-I. Finally, positive and negative effects of {PS}-I are explained using the suggested mechanisms.},

Noting that there is a passionate debate about the design of initial learning, we report evidence from a meta-analysis of 53 studies with 166 comparisons that compared {PS}-I with I-{PS} design. Our results showed a significant, moderate effect in favor of {PS}-I (Hedge’s g 0.36 [95\% confidence interval 0.20; 0.51]). The effects were even stronger (Hedge’s g ranging between 0.37 and 0.58) when {PS}-I was implemented with high fidelity to the principles of Productive Failure ({PF}), a subset variant of {PS}-I design. Students’ grade level, intervention time span, and its (quasi-)experimental nature contributed to the efficacy of {PS}-I over I-{PS} designs. Contrasting trends were, however, observed for younger age learners (second to fifth graders) and for the learning of domain-general skills, for which effect sizes favored I-{PS}. Overall, an estimation of true effect sizes after accounting for publication bias suggested a strong effect size favoring {PS}-I (Hedge’s g 0.87).},

Our understanding of self-regulated learning has been informed by three schools of thought: (1) research on learning styles, (2) research on metacognition and regulation styles, and (3) theories of the self, including goal-directed behavior. Based on these schools of thought, a three-layer model is presented. The innermost layer pertains to regulation of the processing modes. The middle layer represents regulation of the learning process. The outermost layer concerns regulation of the self. Educators and researchers would benefit from an integration of these three frames of reference into a comprehensive model of self-regulated learning.},

The models were compared on four criteria (i.e. background theories, definitions of {SRL}, components included in the models and empirical work). The results show that theoretical background is an important differentiating feature. The two models that resembled each other more than any other two models (i.e. Pintrich and Zimmerman) were inspired by the same background theory (i.e. social cognitive theory). On the other hand, the models that differed most from the other models (i.e. Borkowski and Winne) were also theoretically the farthest removed ones.},

	abstract = {In the quest to identify the key sources of subjective well-being, self-determination theory ({SDT}) has proposed that three basic psychological needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—are fundamental to well-being across cultures. To understand their influence on well-being, we analyzed data from European Social Survey on 27 European countries (n = 48,550) using structural equation modeling with alignment invariance that allowed us to get comparable indicators across the countries. Both across Europe, and within each of the 27 countries, {SDT}’s basic psychological needs—both when examined alone and when examined together—were strongly related to key indicators of well-being (happiness, life satisfaction, and meaning in life) and a key indicator of ill-being (symptoms of depression), even controlling for demographic factors and socio-economic position. Moreover, basic needs substantially and sometimes fully mediated the effects of socio-economic position on well-being, underscoring their status as crucial to human well-being.},

            This chapter reviews how self-determination theory ({SDT}) clarifies the motivational dynamics of entertainment media and informs moral questions of its impact. A growing body of {SDT} research has gone behind the flash and spectacle on the screen to assess the psychological fulfillments and key experiences that account for much of its motivational pull. This work provides a blueprint of the specific experiences, content, and features that deepen fulfillment. As important, {SDT} offers a process model of how fulfilling experiences predict sustained engagement over time. The chapter beings with a review of the research on the motivational pull of video games, whose immersive contexts can provide rich satisfactions of basic psychological needs enhancing intrinsic motivation to play. It then turns to more traditional forms of entertainment media, discussing the recent work applying {SDT} to investigate a process model of engagement with {TV} shows, exploring how basic need fulfillments in narratives impact engagement. Finally, practical considerations as well as directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In the perspective of self-determination theory the central aim of education should be that of enhancing students’ flourishing. Flourishing involves not only the development of cognitive capacities but also capacities for agency, prosocial relationships, and psychological wellness. Strong evidence within self-determination theory, reviewed herein, shows how teaching styles that support students’ basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence foster these aspects of flourishing, enhancing the quality of students’ engagement, learning, and social relationships. Also highlighted are how students’ motivation and agency reciprocally influence teachers’ tendency to be need supportive, such that interventions on both sides of the teacher-student relationship can enhance learning climates. Nonetheless, this body of evidence concerns optimizing need supports within existing school environments, which too often remain mired in policies, practices, and omnipresent evaluations that are not designed for student flourishing, and which instead often harm both students’ and teachers’ well-being and motivation. The chapter’s conclusion includes a call to broaden the criteria by which schools are evaluated to include process as well as outcome targets. Creating the best schools we can imagine entails the assessment and cultivation of what really matters (i.e., process targets) to student flourishing in both their present and future lives.},

            Although the existence of a set of physical needs is well accepted within biology, the question whether humans have a parallel set of psychological needs has been more controversial within the psychological landscape. The identification, characterization, and study of basic needs has been central to the research agenda of Basic Psychological Needs Theory, one of {SDT}’s six mini-theories. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth characterization of the nine criteria that characterize the basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence: essential, psychological, pervasive, universal, inherent, distinct, content-specific, directional, and explanatory. We elaborate on the theoretical and research implications of these criteria and provide a selective review of this rapidly growing body of empirical work. We conclude that basic needs provide a universal and parsimonious framework to account for people’s growth and flourishing as well as their stagnation and problem behavior, while also accounting for the growth-conducive versus toxic effects of different environments.},

	abstract = {In 2014, a union of German research organisations established Projekt {DEAL}, a national-level project to negotiate licensing agreements with large scientific publishers. Negotiations between {DEAL} and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke down without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around 200 German research institutions cancelled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading Elsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions. We investigated the effect on researchers’ publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric perspective, using a dataset of {\textasciitilde}400,000 articles published by researchers at {DEAL} institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with respect to the timing of contract cancellations, research disciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find evidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles from {DEAL} institutions, with the largest year-on-year market share decreases occurring from 2018 to 2020 following the implementation of access restrictions. We also observe year-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations, although the decrease is smaller. We conclude that negotiations with Elsevier and access restrictions have led to some reduced willingness to publish in Elsevier journals, but that researchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier articles, implying that researchers use other methods to access scientific literature.},

It also examined the incremental validity of personality traits above and beyond cognitive ability in predicting academic performance. Results The combined effect of cognitive ability and personality traits explained 27.8\% of the variance in academic performance. Cognitive ability was the most important predictor with a relative importance of 64\%. Conscientiousness emerged as a strong and robust predictor of performance, even when controlling for cognitive ability, and accounted for 28\% of the explained variance in academic performance. A significant moderating effect of education level was observed. The relationship of academic performance with openness, extraversion, and agreeableness demonstrated significantly larger effect sizes at the elementary/middle school level compared to the subsequent levels. Openness, despite its weak overall relative importance, was found to be an important determinant of student performance in the early years of school. Conclusion These findings reaffirm the critical role of personality traits in explaining academic performance through the most comprehensive assessment yet of these relationships.},

People must also learn to apply tools and knowledge in new domains and different situations. Industry specialists report that people at every organizational level must be creative and flexible problem solvers (Lynton, 1989). This requires the ability to apply experience and a definition knowledge to address novel problems. Consequently, learning to think critically, to analyse and synthesize information to solve technical, social, economic, political, and scientific problems, and to work productively in groups are crucial skills for successful and fulfilling participation in our modern, competitive society.{DOI}:10.1080/0968776950030202},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surprising phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

	abstract = {The Cognitive Reflection Test ({CRT}) is a measure of analytical reasoning that cues an intuitive but incorrect response that must be rejected for successful performance to be attained. The {CRT} yields two types of errors: Intuitive errors, which are attributed to Type 1 processes; and non-intuitive errors, which result from poor numeracy skills or deficient reasoning. Past research shows that participants who commit the highest numbers of errors on the {CRT} overestimate their performance the most, whereas those with the lowest error-rates tend to slightly underestimate. This is an example of the Dunning-Kruger Effect ({DKE}). The present study examined how intuitive vs. non-intuitive errors contribute to overestimation in the {CRT} at different levels of performance. Female undergraduate students completed a seven-item {CRT} test and subsequently estimated their raw score. They also filled out the Faith in Intuition ({FI}) questionnaire, which is a dispositional measure of intuitive thinking. Data was separated into quartiles based on level of performance on the {CRT}. The results demonstrated the {DKE}. Additionally, intuitive and non-intuitive errors predicted miscalibration among low, but not high performers. However, intuitive errors were a stronger predictor of miscalibration. Finally, {FI} was positively correlated with {CRT} self-estimates and miscalibration, indicating that participants who perceived themselves to be more intuitive were worse at estimating their score. These results taken together suggest that participants who perform poorly in the {CRT} and also those who score higher in intuitive thinking disposition are more susceptible to the influences of heuristic-based cues, such as answer fluency, when judging their performance.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Despite active learning being recognized as a superior method of instruction in the classroom, a major recent survey found that most college {STEM} instructors still choose traditional teaching methods. This article addresses the long-standing question of why students and faculty remain resistant to active learning. Comparing passive lectures with active learning using a randomized experimental approach and identical course materials, we find that students in the active classroom learn more, but they feel like they learn less. We show that this negative correlation is caused in part by the increased cognitive effort required during active learning. Faculty who adopt active learning are encouraged to intervene and address this misperception, and we describe a successful example of such an intervention.
          , 
            We compared students’ self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large-enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students’ perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods. For instance, a superstar lecturer could create such a positive feeling of learning that students would choose those lectures over active learning. Most importantly, these results suggest that when students experience the increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they initially take that effort to signify poorer learning. That disconnect may have a detrimental effect on students’ motivation, engagement, and ability to self-regulate their own learning. Although students can, on their own, discover the increased value of being actively engaged during a semester-long course, their learning may be impaired during the initial part of the course. We discuss strategies that instructors can use, early in the semester, to improve students’ response to being actively engaged in the classroom.},

            Wie Lehrkräfte ihren inklusiven Mathematikunterricht ausgestalten, wird im Modell der gegenstandsbezogenen Expertise dadurch charakterisiert, welche Praktiken sie zur Bewältigung typischer didaktischer Anforderungssituationen nutzen: Lernvoraussetzungen identifizieren und diagnostizieren, differenzieren, fördern und gemeinsames Lernen anregen. Die qualitative Interviewstudie untersucht die selbstberichteten Praktiken der Lehrkräfte bzgl. der zugrundeliegenden inklusionsbezogenen Orientierungen und Wahrnehmungs- und Denkkategorien. Interviewt werden 17 Lehrkräfte, die ihre Praktiken beschreiben und reflektieren, und zwar alle zur gleichen Unterrichtseinheit „Prozente verstehen“ (Klasse 7). Die qualitative Analyse rekonstruiert fünf typische Leitkategorien: soziale Teilhabe, Beschäftigung, Aufgabenbewältigung, inhaltliche Teilhabe und stufengerechte Lernzuwächse, zwischen denen die Lehrkräfte wechseln. Die Analyse zeigt, wie sich diese Leitkategorien in den Praktiken genauer ausprägen.

            Abstract
            
              Within the model of content-related expertise, we characterize how teachers realize inclusive education in mathematics classrooms by the teaching practices they enact to master typical didactical jobs: (1)
              identify
              potential demands and notice students’ abilities, (2)
              differentiate
              priorities, e.g. learning goals with respect to identified ability and compensate limited abilities by scaffolding, (3)
              enhance
              targeted learning goal with respect to ability, and (4)
              orchestrate
              joint learning. The qualitative interview study investigates teachers’ self-reported practices with respect to the underlying inclusive orientations and categories for perception and thinking. 17 teachers were interviewed, they describe and reflect their practices within the same teaching unit on percentages in Grade 7. The qualitative analysis identifies five recurring leading categories: social participation, occupation, task propensity, content participation and adaptive learning progressions; teachers change between the five. The analysis shows how the leading categories are expressed in the different jobs and practices.},

In one condition, students solved ill-structured problems in groups followed by well-structured problems individually. In the other condition, students solved well-structured problems in small groups followed by well-structured problems individually. Finally, all students solved ill-structured problems individually. Groups who solved ill-structured problems expectedly struggled with defining and analyzing the problems, resulting in poor quality of solutions. However, despite failing in their collaborative efforts, these students outperformed their counterparts in the well-structured condition on individual near- and far-transfer measures subsequently, suggesting a latent productivity in what initially seemed to be failure.},

We then report findings from an ongoing program of research on {PF} in mathematical problem solving in 3 Singapore public schools with significantly different mathematical ability profiles, ranging from average to lower ability. In the 1st study, 7th-grade mathematics students from intact classes experienced 1 of 2 conditions: (a) {PF}, in which students collaboratively solved complex problems on average speed without any instructional support or scaffolds up until a teacher-led consolidation; or (b) direct instruction ({DI}), in which the teacher provided strong instructional support, scaffolding, and feedback. Findings suggested that although {PF} students generated a diversity of linked representations and methods for solving the complex problems, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their problem-solving efforts. Yet despite seemingly failing in their problem-solving efforts, {PF} students significantly outperformed {DI} students on the well-structured and complex problems on the posttest. They also demonstrated greater representation flexibility in solving average speed problems involving graphical representations, a representation that was not targeted during instruction. The 2nd and 3rd studies, conducted in schools with students of significantly lower mathematical ability, largely replicated the findings of the 1st study. Findings and implications of {PF} for theory, design of learning, and future research are discussed.},

The studies also represented only two of our search domains-productive failure and failure-driven memory. The small number of experimental studies on this topic is a telling indication of the state of experimental research in this area. However, they revealed a moderately positive result for the effect of learning from failure. An examination of moderating variables indicated that participants’ grade level, subject matter domain, and study’s duration, while not significant in explaining the differences across the examined studies, showed positive medium effect sizes.

	abstract = {The knowledge required to solve algebra manipulation problems and procedures designed to hasten knowledge acquisition were studied in a series of five experiments. It was hypothesized that, as occurs in other domains, algebra problem-solving skill requires a large number of schemas and that schema acquisition is retarded by conventional problem-solving search techniques. Experiment 1, using Year 9, Year 11, and university mathematics students, found that the more experienced students had a better cognitive representation of algebraic equations than less experienced students as measured by their ability to (a) recall equations, and (b) distinguish between perceptually similar equations on the basis of solution mode. Experiments 2 through 5 studied the use of worked examples as a means of facilitating the acquisition of knowledge needed for effective problem solving. It was found that not only did worked examples, as expected, require considerably less time to process than conventional problems, but that subsequent problems similar to the initial ones also were solved more rapidly. Furthermore, decreased solution time was accompanied by a decrease in the number of mathematical errors. Both of these findings were specific to problems identical in structure to the initial ones. It was concluded that for novice problem solvers, general algebra rules are reflected in only a limited number of schemas. Abstraction of general rules from schemas may occur only with considerable practice and exposure to a wider range of schemas.},

The present investigation represents the first systematic attempt to use a meta-analysis and controlled, longitudinal studies to examine the relations of specific types of motivation to overall academic achievement. The meta-analysis (Study 1) pointed toward a potentially important role of intrinsic motivation in predicting school achievement. Three empirical studies of high school and college students in Canada (Studies 2 and 3) and in Sweden (Study 4) showed that intrinsic motivation was the only motivation type to be consistently positively associated with academic achievement over a one-year period, controlling for baseline achievement. Amotivation was significantly associated with lower academic achievement in Studies 3 and 4. Interestingly, intrinsic motivation was also associated with reduced amotivation in two of our studies and it was reciprocally associated with higher school achievement in another study. Overall, our findings highlight the unique importance of intrinsic motivation for the future academic success of high school and college students.},

The types of motivation described in self-determination theory each co-occur to different degrees and should lead to different consequences.

In the current meta-analysis, we examine these different types of motivation in 344 samples (223,209 participants) as they relate to 26 performance, well-being, goal orientation, and persistence-related student outcomes. Findings highlight that intrinsic motivation is related to student success and well-being, whereas personal value (identified regulation) is particularly highly related to persistence. Ego-involved motives (introjected regulation) were positively related to persistence and performance goals but also positively related with indicators of ill-being. Motivation driven by a desire to obtain rewards or avoid punishment (external regulation) was not associated with performance or persistence but was associated with decreased wellbeing. Finally, amotivation was related to poor outcomes. Relative weights analysis further estimates the degree to which motivation types uniquely predict outcomes, highlighting that identified regulation and intrinsic motivation are likely key factors for school adjustment.},

The two types of internalization are introjection, which entails taking in a value or regulatory process but not accepting it as one's own, and integration, through which the regulation is assimilated with one's core sense of self. Introjection results in internally controlling regulation, whereas integration results in self-determination. An experiment supported our hypothesis that three facilitating contextual factors—namely, providing a meaningful rationale, acknowledging the behaver's feelings, and conveying choice—promote internalization, as evidenced by the subsequent self-regulation of behavior. This experiment also supported our expectation that when the social context supports self-determination, integration tends to occur, whereas when the context does not support self-determination, introjection tends to occur.},

To consider this trend, this article presents the results of a differentiated meta-analysis of 48 treatment comparisons resulting from 30 articles on enhancing self-regulated learning amongst primary school students. Based on recent models of self-regulated learning, which consider motivational, as well as cognitive, and metacognitive aspects [Boekaerts, M. (1999). Self-regulated learning: Where we are today. International Journal of Educational research, 31(6), 445–457], the effects of self-regulated learning on academic achievement, on cognitive and metacognitive strategy application, as well as on motivation were analyzed. As the results show, self-regulated learning training programmes proved to be effective, even at primary school level. Subsequent analysis tested for the effects of several moderator variables, which consisted of study features and training characteristics. Regarding factors that concern the content of the treatment, the impact of the theoretical background that underlies the intervention was tested, as well as the type of cognitive, metacognitive, or motivational strategy which were instructed, and if group work was used as instruction method. Training context related factors, which were included in the analyses consisted of students’ grade level, the length of the training, if teachers or researchers directed the intervention, as well as the school subject in which context the training took place. Following the results of these analyses, a list with the most effective training characteristics was provided.},

This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k = 430, N = 90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated—30\% of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17\% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes—planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control—did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.

The largest effect sizes were obtained for metacognitive strategies (g = 0.40) and resource management strategies (g = 0.39) followed by academic performance (g = 0.37), motivational outcomes (g = 0.35), and cognitive strategies (g = 0.32). Training effects varied for specific self-regulated learning strategies and ranged between 0.23 (rehearsal) and 0.61 (attention and concentration). Moderator analyses revealed differential training effects depending on course design characteristics: Feedback predicted larger training effects for metacognitive and resource management strategies as well as motivation. Cooperative learning arrangements predicted larger training effects for cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The provision of learning protocols predicted larger training effects for resource management strategies. Moreover, training programs based on a metacognitive theoretical background reported higher effects sizes for academic achievement compared to training programs based on cognitive theories. Further, training programs that targeted older students and students with lower prior academic achievement showed larger effect sizes for resource management strategies. To conclude, self-regulated learning training programs enhanced academic performance, self-regulated learning strategies, and motivation of university students.},

Using a course assignment as the learning task, sixty-three students enrolled in a one-year master programme in a teacher education institute responded to an instrument assessing their self-assessment practices (including four self-assessment actions) at the {SRL} Preparatory, Performance and Appraisal phases of the task. Their final scores of the assignment were also collected. The results showed that self-assessment is a fundamental skill for {SRL} and occurs at each {SRL} phase with different patterns. Autoregressive relationships were found for all self-assessment actions between different {SRL} phases. Self-reflection at Performance phase was found to influence feedback seeking at Appraisal phase. Self-directed feedback seeking through monitoring at Performance phase was the strongest and positive predictor of academic achievement; and achievement had negative impact on all self-assessment actions at Appraisal phase.

Self-efficacy measured after one semester (t2) was positively related to both cognitive and metacognitive strategy use at the beginning (t1) and the end of the math course (t3). The use of either strategy was stable from t1 to t3. Once the variance overlap between the learning strategies was controlled for, metacognitive strategy use at t1 was positively and at t3 negatively associated with performance in the math course exam at t4. Greater levels of self-efficacy at t2 also predicted a better exam performance.

These case studies document the processes by which these students were supported to self-regulate their learning in mathematics more effectively. We begin by outlining important instructional foci in mathematics education for intermediate or secondary students with learning disabilities, along with what research indicates are effective instructional processes. In that context, we introduce the theoretical principles underlying the instructional model used here—Strategic Content Learning ({SCL}). Based on analyses of case study data, we describe how {SCL} instruction was structured to promote strategic learning. Throughout the discussion, intervention processes are described in sufficient detail to be of use to practitioners.},

The book addresses key historical, contemporary, and future developments in the field of self-regulation. It first deals with five basic domains of self-regulated learning and performance: social cognitive, cognitive/metacognitive, developmental, motivation and emotion, and co-regulation and socially shared regulation. The book focuses on the adaptation of self-regulatory principles to investigate their effectiveness in specific contexts. Research on self-regulation and technology includes what kinds of knowledge and skills are needed to successfully utilize technology in the modern world and how technology systems can be designed to teach and foster self-regulation. The book also reviews the literature on the role of self-regulation in computer-based learning environments, intelligent tutoring systems and teachable agents, digital games, and computer-supported collaborative learning. It further examines methodological issues in assessing self-regulation of learning and performance such as reliability, validity, diagnostic value, and sensitivity to instruction.},

This requires self-regulated learning ({SRL}) behavior due to the increased autonomy in this instructional approach. Providing students with video-embedded {SRL} support (i.e., prompts and explicit instruction) during the learning activities before class has proven to be an effective strategy in primary and higher education to enhance students’ {SRL} and learning outcomes. The current study aims to replicate the effects of {SRL} support in a Flipped class in secondary education over the course of eight weeks. In total, 115 eighth-grade students from five classes participated in a quasi-experimental study, which measured the effects of {SRL} support on students’ {SRL} (self-reports and online activities), learning outcomes, and satisfaction. We found a positive effect of {SRL} support on learning outcomes, but we could not explain this by differences in students’ {SRL}. Although all the students were generally positive about the flipped learning environment, some students clearly disliked the {SRL} instruction. We conclude that {SRL} support is beneficial for students’ learning but that it should be carefully designed to avoid students’ dissatisfaction, which could potentially nullify these beneficial effects on learning.},

The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning ({SRL}), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding {SRL}, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use {SRL} strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.},

The development of {TPACK} by teachers is critical to effective teaching with technology. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the complex, ill-structured nature of teaching. The nature of technologies (both analog and digital) is considered, as well as how the inclusion of technology in pedagogy further complicates teaching. The {TPACK} framework for teacher knowledge is described in detail as a complex interaction among three bodies of knowledge: content, pedagogy, and technology. The interaction of these bodies of knowledge, both theoretically and in practice, produces the types of flexible knowledge needed to successfully integrate technology use into teaching.},

The question is, however, essential: The public image of the subject (of the science, and of the profession) is not only relevant for the support and funding it can get, but it is also crucial for the talent it manages to attract—and thus ultimately determines what mathematics can achieve, as a science, as a part of human culture, but also as a substantial component of economy and technology. In this lecture we thus discuss the image of mathematics (where “image” might be taken literally!),sketch a multi-facetted answer to the question “What is Mathematics?,”stress the importance of learning “What is Mathematics” in view of Klein’s “double discontinuity” in mathematics teacher education,present the “Panorama project” as our response to this challenge,stress the importance of telling stories in addition to teaching mathematics, and finally,suggest that the mathematics curricula at schools and at universities should correspondingly have space and time for at least three different subjects called Mathematics.},

In the German political discourse, the concept has been introduced without a proper analysis and critical discussion of prior approaches and evidence of the concept and its impact on adult outcomes. In this paper I briefly introduce the historical discourse on future skills of the last 20 years. Based on existing systematic literature reviews and evidence syntheses I summarise the current state-of-the art of research and identify 9 fundamental problems of the concept and funding of future skill initiatives. Among others, the missing connection and systematisation regarding earlier approaches, the missing evidence of effects of future skills on adult outcomes and the lack of measurement approaches are identified as important shortcomings for the promotion of future skills. As an alternative approach I discuss the funding of transfer research within and outside of a domain of expertise.},

            Innovative methods can change the paradigm of teaching mathematics and inspire teachers to espouse new ideas and gain new experiences. The flipped classroom ({FC}) is currently an innovative pedagogical approach that has high potential to transform the teaching of mathematics. In the case study described in this paper, we investigated one mathematics teacher’s transformation of teaching in two mathematics classrooms through implementing interventions based on {FC} methods; furthermore, we identified several key points of {FC} design as well as challenges and opportunities afforded by teaching mathematics in {FCs}. The results of the study showed that the tasks posed by the teacher, the implemented discourse, teacher feedback and scaffolding, and the teaching–learning environment were changed in {FCs}, although the approaches used by the teacher to analyze the tasks and students’ learning were similar to those used in non-{FCs}, which points out the strengths of traditional teaching approaches. The study indicates that although teaching mathematics in {FCs} created some difficulties for teaching, well-designed {FCs} offered a great opportunity to promote students’ mathematical thinking and understanding. Overall, the results highlight that through {FC}, teachers can develop students’ mathematical potential with {FCs}.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Educators sometimes effect changes in education through the implementation of new ideas, and sometimes extraordinary circumstances force them to change their educational approaches, as during the {COVID}-19 crisis. Although we live in a digital age, the limited use of technology in education, particularly prior to the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and teachers’ insufficient experience with online or hybrid learning and teaching approaches resulted in several countries being unprepared for education during the pandemic. The flipped classroom ({FC}) is an innovative pedagogy with the potential to engage students in mathematics education using hybrid education combined with online and face-to-face learning, which is especially important during a pandemic. However, despite the high expectations surrounding this innovative approach, to date, no systematic literature review has discussed the opportunities and pitfalls of {FCs} in mathematics education regarding pandemic-related issues. In the present systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap and highlight the importance of flipping mathematics instruction during the pandemic and beyond. The results, which are based on textual analysis of 97 eligible articles, demonstrate that {FC} is a promising pedagogy that has numerous benefits for mathematics teaching and learning, although it is not a panacea for pandemic-related issues, as it also has several significant pitfalls. Overall, if the mechanism of mathematics education is to be crisis-ready, we should learn from experiences during the pandemic. In this regard, the current review contributes to research in mathematics education with the aim of gaining insight into successful implementations of {FC} pedagogy, not only during the pandemic but also beyond the crisis era of a pandemic.},

This article describes a meta-synthesis of research on children designing and programming computer games that investigates the extent to which there is evidence of benefits for computer science learning and motivation. Over 400 articles were identified, and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis across studies showed some evidence that computer game design and programming can lead to changes in programming knowledge, problem solving, and computer science attitudes and confidence. However, most of the evidence described engagement in computing-related practices and did not measure learning. The findings were mostly positive, although several studies noted more negative attitudes toward programming after making games. The results were similar across different pedagogical approaches, although social interaction may provide unique opportunities for computer science learning. The synthesis resulted in a list of design elements for studying computer game design and programming activities; these can be used to increase the availability of evidence about learning. The article concludes with the identification of gaps in the research and suggestions for additional research.},

	abstract = {Selbständige Wissensaneignung und Lernorganisation sind Schlüsselqualifikationen der Informationsgesellschaft. Die Mixed-Methods-Studie untersucht interindividuelle Unterschiede bei Schülerinnen und Schülern im Umgang mit dem selbst organisierten Lernen am Gymnasium. Es werden vier Lernertypen identifiziert, die durch eine inhaltsanalytische Auswertung von Interviews und zwei Fallbeispiele genauer charakterisiert werden. Aus den Ergebnissen werden Empfehlungen für die Gestaltung selbst organisierter Lerneinheiten abgeleitet. Selbst organisiertes Lernen setzt voraus, dass Lernende zu aktiven Gestaltern ihres eigenen Lernprozesses werden. Die vorliegende Studie geht davon aus, dass nicht alle Schülerinnen und Schüler mit der ihnen zugemuteten Autonomie beim selbst organisierten Lernen konstruktiv umzugehen wissen, da sie sich sowohl hinsichtlich der notwendigen Fähigkeiten zur Selbstregulation des Lernens (Lernstrategien, Metakognition) als auch bezüglich der motivationalen Voraussetzungen zum Lernen unterscheiden. Gegenstand der Untersuchung sind daher interindividuelle Differenzen beim selbst organisierten Lernen bei Schülerinnen und Schülern, die methodisch in einem sequentiellen Mixed-Methods-Ansatz untersucht werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich die vier Lernertypen deutlich voneinander unterscheiden, wenn auch nicht in allen untersuchten Aspekten. Bedeutende Erklärungskraft wird einer besonderen Vorstellung von Lernen zugeschrieben, die sich verstärkt beim Typ der erfolgreichen Lernenden zeigt: Personen dieses Typs betrachten Lernen als Herausforderung und Chance für die persönliche Weiterentwicklung, akzeptieren, dass Lerngelegenheiten aus Ungewissheit beinhalten und betonen gleichzeitig, dass für erfolgreiches Lernen Persistenz notwendig ist.

In Multimedia Learning Richard Mayer explores ways of going beyond the purely verbal by combining words and pictures for effective teaching. Multimedia encyclopedias have become the latest addition to students' reference tools, and the world wide web is full of messages that combine words and pictures. Do these forms of presentation help learners? If so, what is the best way to design multimedia messages for optimal learning? Drawing upon 10 years of research, the author provides seven principles for the design of multimedia messages and a cognitive theory of multimedia learning. In short, this book summarizes research aimed at realizing the promise of multimedia learning - that is, the potential of using words and pictures together to promote human understanding.},

Although this result has been regularly cited in studies of expertise, it is frequently misquoted. It is often claimed that de Groot found no difference in the way that experts and novices investigate a problem. Comparison of expert and novice chess players on de Groot’s problem shows that there are clear differences in their search patterns.

The personalization principle is that people learn more deeply when the words in a multimedia presentation are in conversational style rather than formal style. This principle was supported in 14 out of 17 experimental tests, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.79. Some important boundary conditions are that the personalization principle may not apply to high-achieving students or long lessons. The voice principle is that people learn more deeply when the words in a multimedia message are spoken in a human voice rather than in a machine voice. This principle was supported in 5 out of 6 experimental comparisons, with a median effect size of d = 0.74. A possible boundary condition is that the voice principle may not apply when there are negative social cues such as low embodiment. The image principle is that people do not necessarily learn more deeply from a multimedia presentation when the speaker's image is on the screen rather than not on the screen. This principle is based on 14 experimental tests in which half produced negative or negligible effects, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.20. The embodiment principle is that people learn more deeply when on-screen agents display humanlike gesturing, movement, eye contact, and facial expressions. In 11 out of 11 experimental comparisons, people performed better on transfer tests when they learned from a high-embodied agent than from a low-embodied agent, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.36. A possible boundary condition is that the embodiment principle may not apply when there are negative social cues such as a machine voice.

              A frequent concern about constructivist instruction is that it works well, mainly for students with higher domain knowledge. We present findings from a set of two quasi-experimental pretest-intervention-posttest studies investigating the relationship between prior math achievement and learning in the context of a specific type of constructivist instruction, Productive Failure. Students from two Singapore public schools with significantly different prior math achievement profiles were asked to design solutions to complex problems
              prior
              to receiving instruction on the targeted concepts. Process results revealed that students who were significantly dissimilar in prior math achievement seemed to be strikingly similar in terms of their inventive production, that is, the variety of solutions they were able to design. Interestingly, it was inventive production that had a stronger association with learning from {PF} than pre-existing differences in math achievement. These findings, consistent across both topics, demonstrate the value of engaging students in opportunities for inventive production while learning math, regardless of prior math achievement.},

We systematically reviewed the effects of video on learning in higher education. We searched five databases using 27 keywords to find randomized trials that measured the learning effects of video among college students. We conducted full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias in duplicate. We calculated pooled effect sizes using multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. Searches retrieved 9,677 unique records. After screening 329 full texts, 105 met inclusion criteria, with a pooled sample of 7,776 students. Swapping video for existing teaching methods led to small improvements in student learning (g = 0.28). Adding video to existing teaching led to strong learning benefits (g = 0.80). Although results may be subject to some experimental and publication biases, they suggest that videos are unlikely to be detrimental and usually improve student learning.},

Empirische Befunde belegen positive Effekte von Erklärvideos für kognitive (Wissenszuwachs) sowie für nicht-kognitive Faktoren (z.B. Motivation, Aufmerksamkeit). Dies gilt sowohl für die Rezeption als auch die Produktion von Videoerklärungen. Darüber hinaus befassen sich empirische Studien zunehmend mit der Analyse der Wirkung verschiedener Gestaltungselemente von Erklärvideos (z.B. Interaktivität, Eigenschaften der erklärenden Person). Der Beitrag verfolgt das Ziel, vorliegende empirische Befunde zu verschiedenen Gestaltungselementen zu systematisieren. Zu diesem Zweck wurden 24 Studien gesichtet, die sich mit der Wirkung einzelner Gestaltungselemente befassen. Auf Basis der Befunde werden Gestaltungsempfehlungen für Erklärvideos ausgesprochen. Es zeigt sich, dass insbesondere der Einsatz interaktiver Elemente bedeutsam für den Lernerfolg ist. Zudem wirken sich die gewählte Perspektive (d.h. die Entscheidung, ob das Video aus der Sicht des Erklärenden oder der Person, die das Modell beobachtet, gezeigt wird) sowie das Design (z.B. Ästhetik) signifikant auf den Lernerfolg aus. Mit Blick auf die erklärende Person scheint lediglich das Alter bedeutsam zu sein – nicht jedoch das Geschlecht oder deren Sichtbarkeit im Erklärvideo.},

	abstract = {Video games are becoming increasingly monetized with the addition of in-game purchasing options, which has prompted some comparisons of these products to electronic gaming machines. The expansion and sophistication of ‘microtransaction’ options in online games (e.g., ‘loot boxes’) has also led to concerns about vulnerable users (e.g., adolescents) overspending on these schemes. Currently, there are limited regulatory and/or consumer protection frameworks for video game monetization schemes. This conceptual paper explores some potential social responsibility measures for monetized gaming products to stimulate further discussion and developments in this area. Loot boxes are a focus of this discussion given the current debate on their legality, i.e., similarity to electronic gambling machines. Drawing on social responsibility principles and research in the field of gambling studies, we outline some potential measures in the areas of: (1) game design and in-game purchasing system characteristics, (2) transparency and accuracy of game design and features, (3) broad consumer protection measures, and (4) consumer information and industry accountability. It is hoped that this paper will encourage further discussion among academics, regulators, and the industry. An empirical evidence base is needed to inform the design and implementation of countermeasures for monetization schemes that increase risk of gaming-related harm for some users.},

Mediation analyses showed narcissism was indirectly associated with {POG} via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample. Sadism was directly associated with {POG} among ﬁrst-person shooter game players and indirectly with {POG} via online gaming motives of escape and fantasy among role-playing game players and the total sample.

Previous literature has identiﬁed a number of strong determinants of online purchase intention including values, consumer experience, lifestyle, security, perceived risk, information, and subjective norms and behavioural control. The present study examined the relationship between online mobile gaming addiction and loyalty towards purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps. The present study comprised 430 students from two major Indian universities who completed a short 28-item survey focusing on three variables (i.e., addiction, loyalty towards online games, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features). The results demonstrated that (i) online mobile game addiction shared a signiﬁcant positive relationship with online mobile game loyalty; (ii) online mobile game addiction had a positive relationship with the purchase of online mobile in-game apps, and (iii) online mobile game loyalty increased game users' intention to purchase online mobile ingame apps. The present study is the ﬁrst to investigate loyalty and gaming addiction in relation to the purchase of in-game apps. Game developers will always want to facilitate loyalty among its clientele. However, if the engagement strategies used by gaming operators facilitate addiction as a way of increasing purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps, this raises serious ethical questions which the gaming industry need to address as part of its corporate social responsibility strategy.},

	abstract = {The addictive use of digital games (problematic gaming [{PG}]) is a phenomenon with rising prevalence, especially in adolescents. The period of adolescence is characterized by intense brain maturation processes and increased vulnerability for mental disorders. However, no recent systematic review on functional and structural neural correlates of {PG} is available exclusively for this age group. This paper aimed to close this gap by describing neuroimaging findings and derive clinical implications. A systematic literature search was performed via {PubMed}, {PsycInfo}, and {PSYNDEX} including magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) studies on structural and functional changes in problematic gamers under 20 years of age until December 2020. The findings suggest especially prefrontal brain areas (important for cognitive control functions) but also temporoparietal regions (associated with attention processes and self-concepts), as well as frontolimbic and subcortical regions (connected to emotion regulation and reward processing) to be significantly altered in adolescents with {PG} compared with healthy controls. Reduced interhemispheric connectivity and altered network activity further support theories of neurofunctional imbalance as well as structural deficits to explain addictive behaviours. Based on these findings, interventions should specifically address executive and cognitive-affective deficits together with adolescent-specific developmental tasks such as personality formation. Methodological limitations including heterogeneous {PG} classifications need to be considered. Additional neuroimaging studies on {PG} based on the {DSM}-5 or {ICD}-11 framework for the (Internet) gaming disorder in adolescents with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are highly warranted to understand potential causality and to generate valid and reproducible results.},

            Productive Failure ({PF}) is an instructional design that implements a problem-solving phase which aims at preparing students for learning from a subsequent instruction. {PF} has been shown to facilitate students’ conceptual knowledge acquisition in the mathematical domain. Collaboration has been described as a vital design component of {PF}, but studies that have investigated the role of collaboration in {PF} empirically so far, were not able to confirm the necessity of collaboration in {PF}. However, these studies have diverged significantly from prior traditional {PF} studies and design criteria. Therefore, the role of collaboration in {PF} remains unclear. In an experimental study that is based on the traditional design of {PF}, we compared a collaborative and an individual problem-solving setting. It was hypothesized that collaboration facilitates the beneficial preparatory mechanisms of the {PF} problem-solving phase: prior knowledge activation, awareness of knowledge gaps, and recognition of deep features. In a mediation analysis, the effects of collaborative and individual problem solving on conceptual knowledge acquisition as mediated through the preparatory mechanisms were tested. In contrast to the hypotheses, no mediations or differences between conditions were found. Thus, collaboration does not hold a major preparatory function in itself for the design of {PF}.},

	abstract = {Science explanation videos, especially online ones, have become popular. They cover nearly all topics from school science curricula. Teachers use them in a flipped classroom. Students watch them also in their leisure time. However, there is a lack of research on guidelines that effective science explanation videos should follow. The research on instructional explanations provides essential insights into the effectiveness of science explanation videos. The goal of the present article is to develop a framework for effective science explanation videos. The development consists of two steps. First, criteria for a high explaining quality are derived from the research on effective instructional explanations. That leads to a coherent theoretical framework that requires empirical justification. The second step, therefore, is an exploration of the effects of the framework. We developed two explanation videos: one high explaining quality ({HE}) video following the framework and one low explaining quality ({LE}) video explicitly not following the framework. Both videos, however, are scientifically correct and provide the same learning opportunities. Students from a German high school assigned to two groups (n = 90; n = 86) watched, respectively, the {HE} and {LE} videos, and participated in tests for declarative and conceptual knowledge before and after watching the videos. The main result is that the {HE} group outperformed the {LE} group in the achievement of declarative knowledge (Cohen’s d = .42, p = .007). We interpret that as an argument for the validity of the framework of effective science explanation videos presented in this article.},

Their content and explaining quality remain to this day mostly unmonitored, as well is their educational impact in formal contexts such as schools or universities. In this study, a framework for explaining quality, which has emerged from surveying explaining skills in expert-novice face-to-face dialogues, was used to explore the explaining quality of such videos (36 {YouTube} explanatory videos on Kepler’s laws and 15 videos on Newton’s third law). The framework consists of 45 categories derived from physics education research that deal with explanation techniques. {YouTube} provides its own ‘quality measures’ based on surface features including ‘likes’, views, and comments for each video. The question is whether or not these measures provide valid information for educators and students if they have to decide which video to use. We compared the explaining quality with those measures. Our results suggest that there is a correlation between explaining quality and only one of these measures: the number of content-related comments.},

Zudem wirken sich die gewählte Perspektive (d.h. die Entscheidung, ob das Video aus der Sicht des Erklärenden oder der Person, die das Modell beobachtet, gezeigt wird) sowie das Design (z.B.

              Research on productive failure suggests that attempting to solve a problem prior to instruction facilitates conceptual understanding compared to receiving instruction prior to problem solving. The assumptions are that during the problem-solving phase, students activate their prior knowledge, become aware of their knowledge gaps, and discover deep features of the target content, which prepares them to better process the subsequent instruction. Unclear is whether this effect results from merely changing the order of the learning phases (i.e., instruction or problem solving first) or from additional features, such as presenting problem-solving material in the form of cases that differ in one feature at a time. Contrasting such cases may highlight the deep features and provide grounded feedback to students’ problem-solving attempts. In addition, the effect of the order of instruction and problem solving on procedural fluency is still unclear. The present experiment (

               = 181, mean age = 14.53) investigated in a 2 × 2 design the effects of order (instruction or problem solving first) and of contrasting cases in the problem-solving material (yes/no) on conceptual understanding and procedural fluency. Additionally, the quality and quantity of students’ solution attempts from the problem-solving phase were coded. Regarding the learning outcomes, the {ANOVA} results suggest that for procedural fluency instruction prior to problem solving was more beneficial than problem solving prior to instruction. Merely delaying instruction did not increase conceptual understanding. The contrasting cases did not affect the quality of solution attempts, nor the posttest results. As expected, students who received instruction first generated fewer, but higher-quality solution attempts.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have shown benefits of problem-solving prior to instruction (cf. Productive Failure, Invention) in comparison to direct instruction. However, students’ solutions prior to instruction are usually erroneous or incomplete. In analogy to guided discovery learning, it might therefore be fruitful to lead students towards the discovery of the canonical solution. In two quasi-experimental studies with 104 students and 175 students, respectively, we compared three conditions: problem-solving prior to instruction, guided problem-solving prior to instruction in which students were led towards the discovery of relevant solution components, and direct instruction. We replicated the beneficial effects of problem-solving prior to instruction in comparison to direct instruction on posttest items testing for conceptual knowledge. Our process analysis further revealed that guidance helped students to invent better solutions. However, the solution quality did not correlate with the posttest results in the guided condition, indicating that leading students towards the solution does not additionally promote learning. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the two conditions with problem-solving prior to instruction did not differ significantly at posttest. The second study replicated these findings with a greater sample size. The results indicate that different mechanisms underlie guided discovery learning and problem-solving prior to instruction: In guided discovery learning, the discovery of an underlying model is inherent to the method. In contrast, the effectiveness of problem-solving prior to instruction does not depend on students’ discovery of the canonical solution, but on the cognitive processes related to problem-solving, which prepare students for a deeper understanding during subsequent instruction.},

Attempting to solve problems prior to instruction may lead to a global awareness of knowledge gaps (i.e., awareness without being able to identify which specific component is lacking). These gaps may subsequently be specified by comparing students' solutions to the canonical solution. In our first experiment, the teacher highlighted specific gaps by comparing typical student solutions to the canonical solution before or after problem solving. The second experiment varied the factors form of instruction (with or without student solutions) and timing of instruction (problem-solving prior to or after instruction). Problem-solving prior to instruction triggered a global awareness of knowledge gaps. While this was beneficial for learning when combined with instruction with student solutions, our results indicate that comparing student solutions during instruction to specify the gaps is the most relevant factor.},

In this quasi-experiment, we investigated whether observing someone else engaging in problem solving can prepare students for instruction, and whether examples that show the problem-solving-and -failing process are more effective than those that only show the outcome of this process. We also explored whether the perceived model–observer similarity had an impact on the effectiveness of observing examples of failure. The results showed that observing examples effectively prepares students for learning from instruction. However, observing the model's problem-solving-and-failing process did not prepare students more effectively than merely looking at the outcome.

Yet, research on {PF} shows that students who are involved in problem solving prior to instruction gain more conceptual knowledge from the subsequent instruction compared to students who receive the instruction first. So far, there is no conclusive evidence, however, that the beneficial effects of {PF} are explained by the attempt to generate one’s own solutions prior to instruction. The literature on example-based learning suggests that observing someone else engaging in problem-solving attempts may be an equally effective means to prepare students for instruction. In an experimental study, we compared a {PF} condition, in which students were actively engaged in problem solving prior to instruction, to two example conditions, in which students either observed the complete problem-solving-and-failing process of another student engaging in {PF} or looked at the outcome of this process (i.e., another student’s failed solution attempts). Rather than worked examples of the correct solution procedure, the students observed examples of failed solution attempts. We found that students’ own problem solving was not superior to the two example conditions. In fact, students who observed the complete {PF} process even outperformed students who engaged in {PF} themselves. Additional analyses revealed that the students’ prior knowledge moderated this effect: While students who observed the complete {PF} process were able to take advantage of their prior knowledge to gain more conceptual knowledge from the subsequent instruction, prior knowledge did not affect students’ post-test performance in the {PF} condition.},

Previous research examining active learning definitions in {STEM} fields found that the vast majority of published articles did not define active learning, and those that did defined active learning as interacting, engaging, or not lecturing. The current research extends this {STEM}-focused work by examining both social science and {STEM} science publications. A restricted systematic review of literature was conducted using the {SCOPUS} database, resulting in 547 relevant articles focused on active learning from 2017 to 2022. An examination of the articles indicated that 71\% of the reviewed articles did not define active learning and that the instructional strategies most often cited as fostering active learning emphasized social interactive learning strategies (e.g., small groups, team-based learning, discussion, and cooperative learning), as well as critical thinking strategies (e.g., problem-based learning, case-based learning, and inquiry-based learning). In addition, an in-depth qualitative analysis of the 161 definitions provided within the articles yielded three main emergent themes: (a) active learning is defined as grounded in student-centered constructivist theory, (b) active learning is defined as promoting higher-order thinking and deep learning, and (c) active learning is defined as an instructional strategy involving activity, participation, and engagement. Given these main findings, a representative definition was created: Active learning is a student-centered approach to the construction of knowledge focused on activities and strategies that foster higher-order thinking.},

In the classroom, it is possible to distinguish between time spent by students on-task and off-task. The former is the time in which the student is focused on the learning task; the latter is the remaining time in which they focus on other activities. Understanding the relationship between the two is a concern for teachers, especially for those who teach mathematics and other subjects that are often considered unattractive by students. Given the opportunity afforded by educational video games to motivate and engage math students, an educational drill-and-practice video game was used in this study to practice second-grade arithmetic and study the students' on-task and off-task behavior. We found that when practicing arithmetic using an educational drill-and-practice video game, time on-task decreases during an activity (30 minutes) as well as over the course of the school year (March to December). This study has implications for the length of mathematics classes at schools as well as the need to vary activities during a class.},

	abstract = {Two lines of thinking are becoming increasingly important in higher educational practice. The first derives from constructivist learning theory, and the second from the instructional design literature. Constructivism comprises a family of theories but all have in common the centrality of the learner's activities in creating meaning. These and related ideas have important implications for teaching and assessment. Instructional designers for their part have emphasised alignment between the objectives of a course or unit and the targets for assessing student performance. “Constructive alignment” represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in deriving curriculum objectives in terms of performances that represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learning activities judged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summatively report student performance. The “performances of understanding” nominated in the objectives are thus used to systematically align the teaching methods and the assessment. The process is illustrated with reference to a professional development unit in educational psychology for teachers, but the model may be generalized to most units or programs in higher education.},

We aim to engage students in the learning material by attempting a problem followed by peer marking based on some given solution guideline before they are exposed to another similar problem to solve during the small group classes. We design a quasi-experiment to evaluate the effect of peer marking by introducing an incentive in one such problem set and not in the other. The solution to the class problem is to act as the ‘incentive’, to be released only to the participants of the peer assessment. Using the data of two units from two {UK} universities and ‘incentives’ as instrumental variables to participation, our quantitative findings reveal the effect of participating in one more peer marking as a 3\% increase in final marks on average. The qualitative analysis based on focus group discussions shows that the process increases student engagement, satisfaction, confidence and overall learning responsibility. The challenges often lie to establish a clear understanding of the purpose and the process of peer marking to ensure student buy-in to the system.},

	abstract = {Many studies investigating inquiry learning in science domains have appeared over the years. Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.},

In their response, De Jong et al. (2023) reiterated their advocacy for inquiry approaches, arguing that an emphasis on a mixture of inquiry learning and explicit instruction is needed. The present article rebuts De Jong et al. (2023), in which we: 1) challenge their view of and approach to scientific methods in establishing the efficacy of different instructional approaches; 2) indicate that an underpinning theory to explain the cognitive machinery that drives inquiry-based instructional approaches is missing from their argument; and 3) address the empirical issues arising in their argument. We also highlight potential agreement with De Jong et al. (2023) on the essential role of explicit instruction and thus raise a call to the field to revise current science educational policies and standards to reflect such a role. Our agreements and disagreements advance the debate to a new focus concerning when and how inquiry-based learning and explicit instruction should be used and combined. While De Jong et al. (2023), in their theory-free paper, provided no answer to how explicit instruction and inquiry learning should be combined, we offer our suggestions based on evolutionary psychology and the expertise reversal effect from cognitive load theory.},

This paper addresses this need by introducing a framework of active viewing, which is situated in an established model of active learning to describe students’ behaviors while learning from video. We conducted a ﬁeld study with 460 undergraduates in an Applied Science course using a video player designed for active viewing to evaluate how students engage in passive and active video-based learning. The concept of active viewing, and the role of interactive, constructive, active, and passive behaviors in videobased learning, can be implemented in the design and evaluation of video players.},

With technologies being more applied in science education for enhancing learning engagement, it is important to study how learning environments with different levels of technological engagement ({LTEs}) affect students’ learning. Data were collected from 168 fourth-grade students, ages 9–10, divided into 3 groups of different learning environments: (1) game-based instruction (high {LTE}) and (2) video-based instruction (medium {LTE}) as the two experimental groups, and (3) traditional instruction (low {LTE}) as the control group. Students’ learning was monitored with two tests: scientific concept test and the scientific argumentation skills test. Descriptive and inferential statistics including t-test, {ANCOVA}, and the Johnson-Neyman procedure were used to examine how different {LTEs} affect students’ learning as a group and by level (high-, medium-, and low-achieving). Findings demonstrated that (a) three forms of technology-supported learning significantly improve students’ scientific knowledge and argumentation skills; (b) higher {LTEs} lead to significantly better learning of scientific knowledge, except for some high-achieving students who can learn equally well in traditional instruction; and (c) higher {LTEs} lead to significantly better learning of argumentation skills across all students.},

A sample of 26 undergraduate students of Yonsei University, South Korea, were employed for this study. Pre-tests and post-tests were performed to compare between pre-recorded video lectures and live {ZOOM} lectures. The results show that students prefer pre-recorded video lectures to live {ZOOM} lectures; 53.8\% chose pre-recorded video lectures, 7.7\% chose live {ZOOM} lectures, and 30.8\% chose both pre-recorded and {ZOOM} lectures when they were asked to select their preferred method of learning. Furthermore, we asked several questions, and the mean values were compared. The results of this research showed that pre-recorded video lectures are preferred to live {ZOOM} lectures due to their flexibility, convenience, and educational effectiveness. However, learning through video lectures depends on students’ motivation to get through those materials on their own. Lack of motivation and clear deadlines to watch those video lecture materials could end up in an accumulation of workload, which would be difficult to overcome before examinations.},

This study investigated the effect of teacher-created computer-based video instruction ({CBVI}) using {iPads} on students' academic, behavioural and affective learning in elementary classrooms. The study used a repeated-measures design with counterbalancing to measure the effects of {CBVI} during mathematics lessons on student achievement scores, time on-task and attitudes towards learning. Three year three classes (n = 49) completed three lessons, each using a different mode of instruction: {CBVI} created by the class teacher, {CBVI} created by a stranger, and a traditional live lesson delivered by the class teacher. Results were analysed using a Linear Mixed Model. No significant growth in performance was detected during video instruction, however a significant growth result was achieved for the traditional live teaching mode (p {\textless} 0.001), possibly attributable to the longer duration of experimental session. Behavioural engagement was considerably higher during {CBVI} lessons than live lessons and students preferred their teacher's voice during {CBVI}. Three teachers were interviewed to examine how {CBVI} affected teaching and learning, with two main themes emerging: (1) positive impacts of {CBVI} upon students; and (2) positive impacts on teacher wellbeing. This research indicates benefits for students and teachers when using teacher-created {CBVI}. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that influence cognitive development of students using {CBVI} and to also further explore the effect of {CBVI} on teacher wellbeing.},

            The current work builds on research demonstrating the effectiveness of Productive Failure ({PF}) for learning. While the effectiveness of {PF} has been demonstrated for {STEM} learning, it has not yet been investigated whether {PF} is also beneficial for learning in non-{STEM} domains. Given this need to test {PF} for learning in domains other than mathematics or science, and the assumption that features embodied in a {PF} design are domain-independent, we investigated the effect of {PF} on learning social science research methods. We conducted two quasi-experimental studies with 212 and 152 10th graders. Following the paradigm of typical {PF} studies, we implemented two conditions: {PF}, in which students try to solve a complex problem prior to instruction, and Direct Instruction ({DI}), in which students first receive instruction followed by problem solving. In {PF}, students usually learn from their failure. Failing to solve a complex problem is assumed to prepare students for deeper learning from subsequent instruction. In {DI}, students usually learn through practice. Practicing and applying a given problem-solving procedure is assumed to help students to learn from previous instruction. In contrast to several studies demonstrating beneficial effects of {PF} on learning mathematics and science, in the present two studies, {PF} students did not outperform {DI} students on learning social science research methods. Thus, the findings did not replicate the {PF} effect on learning in a non-{STEM} domain. The results are discussed in light of mechanisms assumed to underlie the benefits of {PF}.},

This analysis used a random effects model with weighted mean difference ({WMD}) as the outcome., Results. Six studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and five were included in the quantitative synthesis. To date, there has only been one prospective randomized comparison of flipped classroom to lecture in student pharmacist education. When comparing final examination scores, there was no significant difference between flipped classroom and lecture based instruction. Only two studies examined the effect of flipped classroom compared to lecture on final course score. This analysis also found no significant difference., Conclusion. Despite a lack of prospective randomized studies, findings from this meta-analysis suggest that flipped classroom may be associated with minimal gains in student knowledge compared to lecture. These findings are important because previous research has estimated that the flipped classroom requires more time to develop and implement. Future studies using prospective randomized designs need to be conducted before widespread adoption.},

	abstract = {Since Bruner’s introduction of discovery learning in the 1960s, there has been an ongoing and intensive debate on the value of inductive teaching methods (e.g., problem-solving followed by instruction, such as in problem-based learning and productive failure) compared to deductive teaching methods (instruction followed by problem-solving, such as direct instruction). Although it has been strongly argued that problem-first inductive methods are incompatible with human cognitive architecture as perceived by cognitive load theory, the main goal of this position paper is to appeal to broaden cognitive load research on inductive and deductive methods, and especially, their orchestration in educational programs of longer duration. We describe eight possible sequences of problem-solving and instruction and conclude that, when well designed, at least six of these sequences can be compatible with cognitive load theory, including productive failure and problem-based learning. We suggest that rather than comparing inductive with deductive methods, future research should also include inductive methods that use different types of supported problem-solving in combination with expository and inquisitory instruction. We propagate a design perspective, looking for the instructional goals, learner characteristics, and other conditions that make selected teaching methods effective, efficient, and attractive.},

	abstract = {Productive Failure ({PF}) facilitates students’ conceptual knowledge by delaying instruction until after problem solving. While {PF} is well investigated in middle and high school students, little is known about its effectiveness in younger students. Studies in younger samples, which implemented delayed instruction designs similar to those used in {PF} studies, showed mixed results. However, these studies did not implement two core design components of {PF}: (1) contrasting and comparing student-generated solutions and the canonical solution during the instructional phase (contrasting activity), and (2) students’ collaboration in small groups during the initial problem-solving phase. Both components can be expected to contribute to the effectiveness of {PF}. In a quasi-experimental study with 228 fifth graders, we implemented the first component (contrasting activity) with all students to establish whether under this condition, problem solving prior to instruction would be more effective for younger students’ conceptual knowledge acquisition than direct instruction (i.e., problem solving after instruction). Further, we experimentally tested the effect of the second component (collaborative vs. individual problem solving) on students’ conceptual knowledge and the number of solution ideas generated during initial problem solving. We found no empirical support for either of our hypotheses. To explore the extent to which students’ collaboration actually achieved its potential and relates to students’ conceptual knowledge and solution ideas in {PF}, we conducted analyses of collaborative processes. Our study adds to the mixed results regarding the superiority of problem solving prior to instruction for young students, thus opening the discussion about age-related prerequisites as boundary conditions for {PF}.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2021, 2022), which seeks to explain how people learn academic material from words and graphics, has developed over the past four decades. Although the name and graphical representation of the theory have evolved over the years, the core ideas have been constant—dual channels (i.e., humans have separate information processing channels for verbal and visual information), limited capacity (i.e., processing capacity is severely limited), and active processing (i.e., meaningful learning involves selecting relevant material to be processed in working memory, mentally organizing the material into coherent verbal and visual structures, and integrating them with each other and with relevant knowledge activated from long-term memory). This review describes how the theory has developed (i.e., the past), the current state of the theory (i.e., the present), and new directions for future development (i.e., the future). In addition, the review includes examples of the events and findings that led to changes in the theory. Implications for educational psychology are discussed, including 15 evidence-based principles of multimedia design.},
